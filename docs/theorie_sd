# Theorie: Software Design

## Scenario:
You start out as a Developer in a new firm and are given a lot of responsibility for a module. The module has grown over some time and only consists of a few classes. The methods of the classes are mostly very long and often hundred lines longer and are barely documented.
What disadvantages arise from this code? Which fundamental Software Design principles are not being upheld?
  
## Answer:  
There's a set of problems that can arise. When he have hundreds of code in a single method it is extremely hard to read and very challenging to understand what the code actually does, without proper documentation, this becomes very time consuming.  
Another disadvantage would be the maintainability after a time period. It is very difficult to identify exactly where you need to make changes, when you need to fix a bug or add a new feature.  
Long methods tend to hide duplicated code that is difficult to identify and refactor.
